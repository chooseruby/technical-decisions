# Principles

## Built together

We want to create this website with the help of the community.

## Using tools built with Ruby

We want to use as much as possible tools build with Ruby

## Support small indie developers

When possible we should try to support indie developers and pick their tools.

## Adopt new Ruby features

As this is also a place of learning we should adopt when possible new language or framework features
